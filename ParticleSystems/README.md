# Particle Systems

This directory explores basics of the concept of Particle Systems[^1], it's pretty simple and you will find two main scripts.

# Main files

- **particle_main.py**: It contains an emitter which creates a random number of particles before expiring, new emitters can be created by mouse click. 
- **ball_death_animation.py**: It contains a ball which hits the ground and explodes into many different balls, simulating a sort of shuttering.

# TO DO

- [ ] The ball death animation could create others "death balls" from the explosion which shutter even more when hitting the walls
