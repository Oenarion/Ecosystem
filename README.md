# ðŸŒ¿ Ecosystem

This repository is a playground for experimenting with algorithms that simulate real-world phenomena and hopefully have fun while doing it!  

Each simulation is implemented in **Python**, primarily using the [`pygame-ce`](https://github.com/pygame-community) library. Other common libraries throughout the project include `random`, `time`, and `math`.

Each directory contains detailed READMEs which SHOULD (optimistically) provide clear explanations for the simulations.

## Inspiration & Credits

This project draws heavy inspiration from [The Nature of Code](https://natureofcode.com/) by [Daniel Shiffman](https://github.com/shiffman), which I thank for his work.  
Many of the simulations are based on or adapted from examples in his book, with additional personal twists and new experiments sprinkled in.
