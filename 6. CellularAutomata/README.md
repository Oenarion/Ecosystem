# ðŸ§¬ Cellular Automata

This repository explores the fundamentals of [Cellular Automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton), computational models made up of discrete cells that evolve over time based on local interaction rules.

One of the most iconic examples is **Conwayâ€™s Game of Life**, which showcases how simple rules can lead to complex, emergent behavior.

## Main Files

### ðŸ”² `1d_CA.py`

A basic **1D cellular automaton**:

- Each cell updates its state based on itself and its two neighbors.
- A new **random rule set** (8 total rules) is generated every generation.
- Generations are **stacked vertically**, giving a clear view of the time evolution.
- Patterns often reach stable or oscillatory configurations.

#### Visual Example

![1D CA](gifs/1d_CA.gif)

> Random rules at every step create unpredictable evolutions that often stabilize or repeat.

### ðŸ§  `game_of_life.py`

A minimal version of **Conwayâ€™s Game of Life**:

- Implements the original ruleset.
- Grid updates over time, showing how patterns grow, die, or stabilize.

#### Visual Example

![GOL](gifs/gol.gif)

> Classic patterns like gliders and still lifes can emerge naturally from random initial states.

---

### `oop_gol.py`

An **object-oriented** take on the Game of Life:

- Adds **color transitions** for visualizing state changes.
- Pressing `C` toggles a mode where **cell age is shown through fading effects**.

#### Visual Example

![OOP GOL](gifs/oop_gol.gif)

> Aging effect helps visualize the history of cellsâ€”newborns light up while old cells fade.

---

### `gol_variation.py`

A creative variation of the Game of Life:

- The canvas is split into **multiple regions**, each running its own simulation.
- Each region evolves independently, creating a layered and diverse grid dynamic.

#### Visual Example

![Variation](gifs/gol_variation.gif)

> Each region lives its own "life"â€”some go still, some stay chaotic.

---

## ðŸ”„ Controls

- Press `R` to reset the simulation (available in most scripts).
- Press `C` in `oop_gol.py` to toggle the aging visualization.
